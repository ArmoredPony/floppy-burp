# Floppy Burp

This is a clone of famous Flappy Bird game. It is written in Rust on Bevy game
engine for self-education purposes and fun.

It features resources, animations, states, events, collisions, gizmos to debug
collisions and other insanity that Bevy operates on. The dev profile should be
built with `--features bevy/dynamic_linking` option. This feature is not specified
in *Cargo.toml*.
